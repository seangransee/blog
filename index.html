One of the bad decisions we made when building our schema was defining a scalar field with a name that would likely be used in the future by a full object.
Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re modeling a Building containing multiple Rooms, and you start with a schema like this:

One of the core promises of GraphQL is that you can build an API without versioning or breaking changes. Breaking changes occur when a field gets removed or its return type gets modified. In a perfect world, you&rsquo;d continue adding fields and types as your API evolves without ever needing to remove or modify anything.

Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re modeling the users in a set of companies. Each company has offices scattered across multiple cities, each of which is split into departments that contain a collection of users. It might be tempting to model your schema like this to keep it lean:

For fields that could potentially return a huge set of data, returning the entire result set in an array just doesn&rsquo;t cut it. We have one field that returns time series data scoped to a time range, and that field could potentially return millions of results when scoped to a large enough time range.

Pretty much every API needs to support an access pattern where you need to be able to query for a single user, and you also need to query for multiple users. (Replace &ldquo;user&rdquo; with any type of data your application models.

            I love GraphQL. Since deploying our initial GraphQL API at SwipeSense, the speed at which we&rsquo;ve been able to build new capabilities into our applications has been unparalleled by any REST-based system I&rsquo;ve worked with.
If I had to pick a downside to adopting GraphQL, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s the newness of the whole ecosystem. The spec is very loose (by design), and it hasn&rsquo;t been around long enough for many best practices to emerge.

            <p>About three years ago, I was involved in the most heated argument I&rsquo;ve experienced thus far in my career. I wish I could say it was about something important with long-term consequences, like a decision about which data store or framework to use. Nope. It was about code formatting. Specifically, the argument was about tabs vs spaces in a spectacle that was a little too similar to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoOG6ZeyUI">scene from Silicon Valley</a>.</p>

<p>Everyone I&rsquo;ve worked with agrees that code should follow a consistent style. It&rsquo;s easy to set up a linter that will fail your CI build when these styles aren&rsquo;t being followed. But standard linters fail to accomplish two things that I&rsquo;ve always viewed as necessary evils when programming with a team: deciding on styles, and following them.</p>

<p>My world was rocked when my team started using <a href="https://prettier.io/">Prettier</a>. Prettier is an <strong>opinionated code formatter</strong>. It automatically formats your code based on styles that the creators of the tool have decided upon.</p>

          <div class="content">
            <p>A couple weeks ago, I migrated my blog from Tumblr to a static site generator. (I ended up settling on <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, but my choice of tool is irrelevant for this post.) When it came to deployment, I decided to have the generated HTML live on GitHub Pages since it&rsquo;s free, easy to set up, and my source code (content, theme, and configuration) were going to live there anyway.</p>

<p>The easiest way to accomplish this with minimal setup is just to have your site generator output your built site in a folder called <code>/docs</code>. Rebuild your site after any change you make, push to <code>master</code>, and you&rsquo;re good to go.</p>

<p>This solution was fine at first, but it got a little annoying having to manually re-build my site and commit the output of that build on every change. Not to mention the fact that committing build artifacts to version control broke my heart a little. I wanted a way to keep <em>only</em> my source chances in my git history (with the build folder in <code>.gitignore</code>), and have the build and deployment process happen automatically when I pushed my source code to GitHub.</p>
