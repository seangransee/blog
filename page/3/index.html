            &#13; The world isn’t run on ideas alone. Having a world-changing idea is great, but many big ideas are essentially worthless without proper execution. During one evening of the hackNY summer series, the 2012 Fellows got down to business with Chris Dixon. Chris is the co-founder of Siteadvisor (acquired by McAfee) and Hunch (acquired by eBay), as well as an angel investor. In this candid discussion about the business side of tech startups, Chris talked about the successes and failures he’s seen in the startup scene and gave us many tips for turning our dream business ideas into a reality.

            A professor recently described his attendance policy like this:
&#13; &#13; Attendance isn't required. However, if you don't show up to class you're losing a lot of money. Here's your yearly tuition. Now let's divide that by the number of classes a typical student takes in a year and then by the number of lectures this course has. One hundred dollars. You're losing $100 for every hour you don't show up to class.

            A couple weeks ago, I created a website called WikiLoopr. Hours after it went live, the site exploded on Hacker News, made its way around Reddit and Twitter, and got featured in an NBC News tech blog. Those first 24 hours brought in over 40,000 hits to the site.
The site went live on the same day that I came up with the idea. Plus, I&#8217;ve never paid a dime for hosting.

            Whenever someone asks me how my summer was, I usually start rambling on and on, unable to contain my excitement. This is my first attempt to finally put my thoughts about this past summer into coherent sentences.
I&#8217;ll start with an analogy. Since a lot of my friends outside tech are very familiar with theatre, I&#8217;ll use that as the basis of my analogy.
Imagine being an aspiring actor. Someone gives you the opportunity to live in New York City on the same floor as 30 other aspiring actors without paying a dime.

            During my two years of college, I've spent one year as a film major and one year as a computer science major. Computer science is without a doubt the one I’ve found to be easier and less time consuming.
&#13; Most people who hear this think I’m crazy. At my university, the school of communication (which includes film majors) is stereotypically the one where students get to slack off and have obnoxious amounts of free time.

You and your team of oompa loompas are on a mission to create the greatest cake the world has ever tasted. You all have your own specialty. Stroompa is an expert at creating sweet, delicious strawberry toppings. Boompa ain’t messing around when it comes to cake batter. And choompa? Well, let’s just say that chocolate is kinda his thing.

Your city has just begun its annual Cake Tour Extravaganza. As a die-hard cake lover, you couldn’t be more excited for today.
The concept is simple. You can walk into any participating bakery in the city and try some cake. Afterwards, the bakery directs you to the location of another bakery.

You like cake, right? Of course you do. But you’re not good at making cake.
Your friend (let’s call him the cakemaster) teaches you how to bake the perfect cake. You learn which store to go to, which shelf each ingredient is on, and how to follow the recipe. You now know how to bake the perfect cake.

            Nothing mind-boggling about this. Just an observation I made tonight….
&#13; Back in the day, getting an answer to a simple question in Google required the following steps:
&#13; Type query&#13; Click ‘Search’&#13; Scan results&#13; Click best result&#13; Find answer
(sometimes the answer is in the results, making 4 and 5 unnecessary)&#13; Question: What date did Facebook launch?
Answer: February 4, 2004
&#13; 
&#13; Then Google started giving answers above the search results, eliminating the need for you to leave the page or even look at the results.
