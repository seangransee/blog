            This post might seem like it's about Breaking Bad, but it's really about television as an art form. There are no spoilers until the end where it's clearly marked, so most of this post is safe for anyone to read.
I haven't felt this way in 6 years, 2 months, and 8 days.
I remember the weeks leading up to July 21, 2007. All the theories. All the speculation. Who will live?

            I just made the biggest decision of my life thus far.
Sure, there are decisions I've made that seemed like big ones at the time. But they weren't. Where to go to college? That wasn't a decision. My dream school was the first one I got accepted into, so the choice was clear. What to study? There was only one career that I wanted to pursue at the time, so that wasn't much of a decision either.

            I don't think I've ever truly said goodbye before.
Sure, I've said plenty of goodbyes in the past. But none like this. None of the others felt as real as this. Or as sudden.
I guess the first time I had to say goodbye to people was right before going to college. Goodbye to all my high school friends. But that was more of a "see ya later" to anyone I really cared about.

            This is the broadest subject I could possibly write about. I&#8217;m not going to attempt to do it justice. Instead, I&#8217;m going to reflect on a very special night.
This night wasn&#8217;t particularly memorable. Nothing spectacular happened. But it involved a lot of people, which is what made it special. Not any more special than countless other nights involving lots of people, but special nonetheless.
It started after a week of near-isolation.

            I know I&#8217;m not a fantastic writer. But if I actually paid attention to all the feedback I hear about my writing, I&#8217;d totally think I am.
In an personal, informal setting, most feedback is crap. It&#8217;s heavily biased to be positive towards the receiver. Most people want to make others feel good about the work they do. While this isn&#8217;t a bad thing by any means, it&#8217;s definitely something to be aware of.

            If you've never programmed before and want to start building that skill, I think JavaScript is the best place to start. I'm not claiming this to be the absolute truth, since it really depends on why you want to start and what you want to do with your programming skills. These are just my opinions and reasons why I believe JavaScript the best place to start for the average person who wants to start coding.

Consider the following situation:
 There is a delicious cake. Chuck Norris* must jump up and down until the cake is not delicious anymore.
 Will Chuck Norris ever stop jumping? Let’s look at a few scenarios:
 The cake is outdoors. It gets rained on and becomes soggy, therefore it is not delicious anymore.
