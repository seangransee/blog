            I plan on creating a web-based game where using CTRL+F to search for text on a page would be cheating. To stop this from happening, I created a jQuery plugin that stops certain HTML elements from being searched.
&#13; View the source code to use it in your own project, and check out the demo to see it in action.
&#13; How to use:&#13; Include jQuery and disableFind.js.
&#13; Call the disableFind() function on the element(s) you want to make unsearchable.

            If you’re serious about your website, you can’t afford long pageload times. Unfortunately, most of us (myself included) don’t have the cash to drop on a dedicated server and are forced to use cheap, shared hosts that cost less than $150 a year. While these hosts are adequate for serving static content, they don’t do a great job at serving dynamic content from content management systems such as WordPress and Drupal.

            For my latest website, I decided to try something a little different. I wanted to take a stab at a single page design with multiple sections. I&rsquo;ve seen it done a few times before, but the style isn&rsquo;t even close to being commonplace.
There are a couple advantages to having a one-page website. First of all, it loads very quickly. Since you don&rsquo;t have to deal with a CMS or a database you can get away with just having one HTML file, one CSS file, and one Javascript file.

            There are a few different types of classes in college. First, there are the classes in my major that are directly relevant to my field of study. Second, there are classes that are fun and interesting, but completely optional. And then there’s a third kind: required classes that don’t necessarily relate to anything I’m studying, usually called gen eds.
&#13; The latter category is the most frustrating. These are the classes where I usually feel like I’m not having fun or learning anything useful.

            1. Practice on your own
&#13; To get started, all you need is a computer with internet access, which you likely already have if you’re a college student. You don’t need to work with anybody or practice on anybody. You can start projects and build up valuable experience on your own time.
&#13; 2. Logical thinking
&#13; Computer science is all about thinking logically. Enough practice in the field can move you to make more rational decisions in day-to-day life.

            I have a lot of stuff to do. I’m taking a full load of classes, working a couple jobs, serving on a few exec boards, and I have obligations to my friends. People are always contacting me via email, Facebook, and text message giving me new tasks every day. So it makes sense to always stay connected and tackle multiple tasks at once, right?
&#13; Wrong!
&#13; I went along with this mindset for most of last year.

            Some years have had really big moments. Moments that hugely influenced my life, for better or worse, and suddenly changed who I am and how I see the world. Leaving a school that I hated going to for 10 years (2006). My dad’s death (2008). Going to college (2010).
&#13; Which brings us to 2011, a year with so many life-changing moments, I barely know where to begin. I’ll attempt to go through this year’s biggest moments and bring you up to speed on how I got to where I am today.

            Something very peculiar just happened. Something that invoked a feeling so strange that I don’t know if I’ll be able to properly put it into words. So here I am, lying in bed in the dead of night, trying to capture this moment on my phone, because I feel like changing my position might make it slip away.
&#13; It happened shortly after I went to bed. I got a text from a friend, and replied with something about how I can’t do anything tonight because I have to go to work tomorrow.

            I’m in love… with a musical. The most unexpected, obscene, blasphemous, sweet, heartwarming, clever, and hilarious musical I’ve ever listened to. That’s right… I haven’t evenseen this show yet, but the broadway cast recording is enough to inspire me to blog about it.
&#13; It’s called The Book of Mormon, and I find the story fascinating – not just the show’s plot, but the story surrounding the production. For one, it’s Trey Parker and Matt Stone’s first venture into the world of musical theatre – two men who spent their entire career in animated television and film.

            After years of procrastinating, I’m finally starting a blog. Why am I starting a blog? Couple reasons.
&#13; To clear my head. At this point in my life, I have a bunch of thoughts bouncing around in my head. Sure, I could tell them to my friends, but I’d rather share them with the world (well, whoever cares enough to read this). Who knows? Maybe this will start some good ol’ internet discussions.
