        <div class="content">
          <p>Some years have had really big moments. Moments that hugely influenced my life, for better or worse, and suddenly changed who I am and how I see the world. Leaving a school that I hated going to for 10 years (2006). My dad’s death (2008). Going to college (2010).</p>&#13;
<p>Which brings us to 2011, a year with so many life-changing moments, I barely know where to begin. I’ll attempt to go through this year’s biggest moments and bring you up to speed on how I got to where I am today.</p>&#13;
<p>Let’s start at the beginning. January 2011. My friends were awesome and I was halfway through freshman year at my dream school. Life was already pretty good. <em>But the ball hadn’t started rolling yet…</em></p>&#13;
<p>Then I got a bid from the Delta Chi fraternity. Boom. First life-changing moment, and we’re only at the first week of January. To this day, my brothers are always there for me and continue to lead me to new opportunities.</p>&#13;
<p>A couple months later, I received an email from a brother letting everyone know about a job opening where he worked. I almost deleted that email. I had enough money saved up that I didn’t really need a job at that point. I figured I could hold out until the summer, where I had already committed to a cashier position at the pool in my hometown. But that little voice inside my head told me to reply to that email, so I did. <em>That decision changed my life more than I will ever know.</em></p>&#13;
<p>Fast forward to May. I’m happily working at a research lab with two of my good friends. The hours are flexible and the work is enjoyable. I quickly become comfortable with the lab and start making new friends. <em>And the ball’s only halfway down the hill.</em></p>&#13;
<p>Late May. I meet someone at work that I don’t recognize. We talk for a few minutes and I find out he used to work in my seat and he was enrolled in the same major as me. Now he’s the CEO of a company he started in college. He offers me summer work at his startup. I hesitantly accept. <em>If only I knew how important how important that decision would become…</em> (Do you sense a reoccurring theme here?)</p>&#13;
<p>June. Big milestone right here: I quit my cashier job at my hometown pool and decided to continue working at the research lab and the startup company. Instead if driving 5 minutes to work, I’m on a train 2.5 hours each way. And you know what? It was totally worth it.</p>&#13;
<p>September. One day I’m in Mountain View inside the world headquarters of Google and the next day I’m in Palo Alto having breakfast with a successful Silicon Valley entrepreneur. He convinces me to switch my major to computer science. I can’t thank him enough for that. He guided me head-on into my true passion.</p>&#13;
<p>November. I get involved with another startup. This time a non-profit.</p>&#13;
<p>Which brings me to today. I am now working for a handful of people who are some of the best mentors I could ever ask for. I got my foot in the door in Silicon Valley. I’m now studying my passion. And most importantly, I have friends that help me out as much as I help them.</p>&#13;
<p>Now you may notice that quite a few details are missing from this story. Those will be topics for future blog posts. There was just too much awesome packed into one normal-sized year.</p>&#13;
