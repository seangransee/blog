          <p>I live with four other hungry college students. I've been cooking for them (and friends that occasionally join us) about once a week. Here are some of my favorite recipes, along with some of my personal notes.</p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>Swiss Chicken Casserole</strong></p>
<p>Recipe:&nbsp;<a href="http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Swiss-Chicken-Casserole-II/Detail.aspx?evt19=1">http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Swiss-Chicken-Casserole-II/Detail.aspx?evt19=1</a></p>
<p>I bumped the serving size up to 10. This, along with a side of steamed vegetables, made the perfect amount for a 9-person dinner party. Instead of using cream of chicken soup, I used cream of mushroom soup with garlic. That substitution added a great additional flavor to the dish. With the increased serving size of 10, it took about 75 minutes to bake and probably could have stayed in the oven a little longer.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Side of carrots and broccoli</strong></p>
<p>This went perfectly with the chicken casserole above for a 9-person dinner party. Beware: it takes quite a while to steam enough vegetables for that many people.</p>
<p>I started by boiling a bot of water and putting a colander above it. This is where I put each round of vegetables after they had been steamed to keep them warm until I was ready to serve the meal. (I know this isn't a conventional use for a colander, but it worked great!) Then I put as many vegetables (baby carrots and broccoli) as I could in a steamer and steamed them for 12 minutes. After steaming, I dumped them into the colander that was above the boiling pot of water. I think I did this 5 times before I had enough.</p>
<p>After all the vegetables were steamed, I dumped them from the colander into a bowl, sprinkled in some freshly ground salt and pepper, and drizzled melted butter into the bowl. Delicious.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Cajun Chicken Pasta</strong></p>
<p>Recipe:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.budgetbytes.com/2013/09/cajun-chicken-pasta/">http://www.budgetbytes.com/2013/09/cajun-chicken-pasta/</a></p>
<p>This one was amazing. However, the serving sizes were totally off. To feed four people, I had to use two chicken breasts and a pound of pasta. I couldn't find fettuccine at the store so I substituted linguini, which was fine. I also used a bit more spices than called for to balance out the increased chicken and pasta. I didn't have cayenne pepper, so I used a teaspoon of crushed red pepper. That gave the dish a nice spicy aftertaste that wasn't too overwhelming.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Turkey and Spinach Pasta Bake</strong></p>
<p>Recipe:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.budgetbytes.com/2013/11/turkey-spinach-pasta-bake/">http://www.budgetbytes.com/2013/11/turkey-spinach-pasta-bake/</a></p>
<p>I don't have much to say about this one, other than the fact that it was yummy.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Skillet Ground Beef Stew</strong></p>
<p>Recipe:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/skillet-ground-beef-stew/1fc970ea-5bff-4270-89d1-eff133c4214c">http://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/skillet-ground-beef-stew/1fc970ea-5bff-4270-89d1-eff133c4214c</a></p>
<p>This recipe is the perfect amount for 3 people. Very filling and satisfying.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Pot Roast</strong></p>
<p>I make one of these every week for all 5 of us.</p>
<p>I generally get about 3.5 pounds of stew meat (chuck works great) and throw it in a crock pot. Then chop up 3 carrots, 4 potatoes, half a large onion, 8 mushrooms, and throw that all in the pot. Mix 2.5 teaspoons of pot roast seasoning with 1.5 cups of water and pour into the crock pot. I usually cook on high heat for 2 hours, followed by low heat for 4 hours. This allows me to start cooking the roast at noon and have it ready by 6pm.</p>
<p>The great thing about this is that it can stay warm in the crock pot until everyone comes home to eat dinner.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Lunch salad</strong></p>
<p>This is my go-to lunch. I add arbitrary amounts of the following to a bowl.</p>
<ul>
<li>Chicken breast (which I cooks on the stove while I'm making the rest of the salad.</li>
<li>Spring mix</li>
<li>Slided mangos</li>
<li>Slivered almonds</li>
<li>Flax seeds</li>
<li>Crumbled feta cheese</li>
<li>Cucumbers (only occasionally, because they go bad so damn fast)</li>
<li>Vinaigrette dressing</li>
</ul>
<p>Mix and eat. Yum.</p>
